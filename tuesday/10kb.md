# 10 kb or bust: the delicate power of webpack and babel

> Not every app needs to work on 2G on a low power device. Know your audience

Today we'll be talking about 2G, low powered devices.
- 2g === 14kbps
- 3G cdma === 144kbps

> 2G is slower than a 56k modem

> If this is a competition, Bangalore is kicking San Francisco's ass.

** Vue is the second smallest framework: 0.71 secs on 2g**

### @babel/preset-env
- leverages more built in es6 stuff
- define relative targets
- best first fix

### let's tree shake
- eliminates unused code from a bundle
- tree shaking is *live code inclusion* not *dead code elimination*.
- `lodash-es`
- using the es6 module syntax allows for static analysis for more intelligent tree shaking
- `"module": false`
- need webpack -> uglifyjs to get full benefit

### use builtins
- babel tries to include a bunch of polyfills
- flag for prest-env which only lets you control the polyfills included

### loose mode
- gives you the code for the 90% of use cases.
- can always switch back to strict mode if needed

### build using `NODE_ENV="PRODUCTION"`
- in general, produces slimmer results based on stripping out developer quality of life tools

### code splitting
- really difficult to get right
- need to get pretty substantial savings in order to make up for additional http calls and glue
- splits under about 100kb are not worth it generally

### module concatenation plugin
- exclusive to webpack 3
- places all modules in a single context which limits the amount of closures
- it's way faster

### source maps
- don't inline source maps in prod

### image skeletons
- generated svgs based on the images
- nothign, placeholder, solid,

### brotli
- alternative to gzip
- 6% improvement

### 10 kb or bust
- initial payload should be under 10kb

### [sfo](https://github.com/btholt/sfo)
- instant build process
- `npx sfo dev|prod entryPoint.js`
