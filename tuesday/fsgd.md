# FSGD and the art of delivering value

- Took construction feature and added to their IT/OPS product...
- then added it to mobile...
- then added marketing, sales and training materials...
- then they rebranded the whole application
- then just role it out all at once at a conference

Took too much
1. coordination
1. teams
1. meetings
1. hours

Takeaway: **let's never do that again**

Did not apply lean/agile principles to a product that tries to encourage them. As they scaled up staff, strong culture of lean/agile was diluted. Needed to redouble focus on process.

- Frequent
 - speed
 - consistency
 - predictability
 - provides tighter feedback loops
 - aids in prioritization
 - allows you to pivot more quickly
 - builds trust
- Small
 - allows frequent to happen
 - based on queuing theory
 - allows for slack in the system
 - some things may appear big, but if you dig deeper, you can come up with creative solutions
 - if something turns out larger, put it on the shelf and come back to it later
- Good
 - can't be bad; shouldn't be perfect

 - TL;DR
   - Tested
   - Logged  (including user analytics)
   - Documented
     - how to build/test
     - how to set up
     - config options and examples
     - API usage examples
   - Reviewed (no self merge policy)
     - mentoring
     - cross-train
     - team building
     - find bugs
 - Legacy Code: boy scout rule
- Decoupled
  - opposite of coordinated
  - opposite of damaging
    - every new feature behind a flag
    - ship new stuff, but don't tie to marketing
